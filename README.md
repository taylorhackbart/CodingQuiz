## Technologies Used
To create these pages, we have a very basic html page with some css styling to create the box. The main portion of this webpage has been developed using JavaScript. 

## Problems I faced
I had a lot of problems creating this quiz. The hardest part for me was after creating a function, knowing when to call it at the right time. 

## Credits
This was so hard, so many people helped me, so thank you to all of my classmates!
